### Maze Generator
A personal study project that generates mazes using BFS, DFS, or Randomized Prim algorithms. The project supports square, hexagonal, and octagonal grid cells. It also includes functionality to create GIFs demonstrating the maze being generated in real-time.

## Features
Multiple Maze Algorithms

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Randomized Primâ€™s Algorithm

## Multiple Cell Shapes

Square cells

Hexagonal cells

Octagonal cells

## Visual Generation

Generates an animated GIF to show the step-by-step construction of the maze
